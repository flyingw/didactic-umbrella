# Ethereum playground project

## Run 
clone Parity near `umbrella` project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/flyingw/parity-ethereum.git
```

If something goes wrong check `path` for all deps in `eth/Cargo.toml`
By default `parity` should be located on the same level with `umbrella` so path relative to `eth` folder should be
```
../../parity-ethereum/
```

run with
```
$ cargo run
```
